# Homework-1 Jake Thomason  

# In working with Horiseon, The first thing that I did was add an accessibility feature into the head of the HTML and added a scaling function so the website was more accessible on different screen sizes. Then I went through and fixed a link that was not working properly and added an "alt" text for all of the images. After that i went into the CSS for the document and consolidated a lot of the different CSS properties because the way it was set up before there would be 3 CSS elements that would apply the exact same formatting to 3 different classes. Instead I consolidated the CSS into 1 element instead of 3 so it would apply the exact same properties across 3 different classes using only one CSS element. I also went through and organized and commented within the CSS to explain not only what classes and tags they applied to but tried to give a positional explanation so someone would be able to see how the CSS effected the website visually.
